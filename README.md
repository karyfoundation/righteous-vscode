# Righteous for Visual Studio Code
[Righteous](https://coding.standards.kary.us/tools/righteous) is an __Experimental__ Code Formatter for CSS that implements the [Kary Coding Standard](https://coding.standards.kary.us/languages/css). It is written as a reconstructing formatter; It means righteous parses the code into an AST (abstract syntax tree) and then rewrites that tree to CSS. This technique ensures everything is based on the standard.
